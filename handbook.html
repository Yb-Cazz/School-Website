            <li>
                The acceptance of offer of admission into the University by the student is a clear evidence that the student

                the governance and peaceful coexistence of all stakeholders in the University. Such acceptance equally
                implies that the student is obliged to be a responsible member of the academic community, in learning,
                character and conduct.
